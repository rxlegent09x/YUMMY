                >Recently, the news regarding the
                acquisition of Uber eats by Zomato has been quite popular.
                Zomato has acquired the Indian operations of its competitor Uber
                Eats, the <strong>food delivery</strong> business run by Uber,
                for around $350 million with which the transaction marks the
                first big consolidation move in the cash-intensive online
                food-delivery market, led by Swiggy and Zomato. Nowadays, the
                concept of ordering food online is not an unusual thing.<strong>
                    Food delivery&nbsp;</strong>applications are those
                applications which offer you to deliver you mouth-savoring
                delicacies with the same price charge as your favorite
                restaurant does with a minimal amount of delivery charges, which
                technically means you order your favorite meal, there is timely
                receipt of your order with the comfort of your home or at any
                place you would like to have your meal. Dominos, Foodpanda,
                Swiggy, Zomato, etc, some of the most popular apps among masses.</span></p><p><span
                >Thus, the development of modern
                technology has given an opportunity to the food industry to
                expand their horizons along with ineffective cost methods. In a
                true way, the popularity of India’s<strong> food-delivery
                </strong>applications is inspiring to make restaurants to think
                differently. So, even if you are a person considering to &nbsp;
                start such an option as a business for your own or even a
                customer, you will find it interesting to even know about:&nbsp;</span></p><p><span
                ><strong>&nbsp;Following are the important

                >a.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As per the recent
                key amendment in the <strong>Consumer Protection Act, 2019</strong>
                &nbsp;definition of “<strong>goods</strong>” under section 2(20)
                of the CPA, 2019 has been amended to include “food” as defined
                in the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. “<strong>Goods</strong>“
                &nbsp;shall mean every kind of movable property and includes
                “food” as defined in clause (j) of sub-section(1) of section 3
                of the <strong>Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006;”</strong></span></p><p><span
                >Thus, &nbsp; by widening the scope of the

                    Platforms</strong>” would come within the fold of CPA, 2019.
                It also makes it important for the food business operators to be
                aware of the rights of consumers under the legislation and
                comply with its obligation accordingly.</span></p><p><strong><span

                the companies that provide a platform for restaurants on their
